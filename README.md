#CSharpExamples#

These are public domain examples I made on C# and using Monodevelop, I made this to learn, experiment and share.

##AccessingPrivates##

These is an example of how to access to the content of a private member of an object. This is not a good idea but since I can made this on PHP very easy (binding a clousure) I want to know if there is a way to make the same thing on C#.

##PasswordChecker##

In this project I experiment with Nunit.Framework. This is a library for password checking based of different rules.

* 2014-02-18 Start the project as an example of the very same thing made on PHP.

There is a lot to do. Feel free to contribute and maybe we can make a SOLID library.
